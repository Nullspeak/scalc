scalc - Simple Calculator

My first foray into parsing and evaluating, a simple commandline calculator that currently supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on double floats.
In the future I'd like to implement an int type along with some bitwise logic, paren processing for scopes, and support for more than 1 operation.
For now though, this is just a toy to play with. It's written in C89/C90 and passes GCC 9.3.0 in pedantic mode with -Wall and -Wextra with no messages.

This code is under the BSD 0-clause license. See the COPYING file for more info.
